# IPL-prediction
This project is a Cricket Score Predictor built using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and machine learning. It predicts the final score of a T20 match based on live match inputs such as venue, batting and bowling teams, striker, bowler, current runs, wickets, overs, and the strikerâ€™s position. The model uses label encoding for categorical features and scaling for numerical ones, with a trained regression model (like Linear Regression or Random Forest) to generate predictions. The user interface is built using ipywidgets, allowing interactive dropdowns and input boxes within the notebook. When the user clicks the "Predict Score" button, the input data is processed and fed to the model, and the predicted total is displayed instantly. This project is useful for learning end-to-end machine learning deployment in Jupyter and for exploring how data science can be applied in sports analytics
